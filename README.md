# Sentinel AAT - HD. 
A case variant to suit HDZERO and CADDX which allows HDMI cable to route through the casing. This can terminate on the case in rear panel using an HDMI panel mount or through the base and into a display / HDMI switch or HDMI adapter to a 3m HDMI cable for goggles.

- 2 * 6807 2RS bearings
- Flexible coiled HDMI male mini to HDMI male angled mini 
- HDMI Male to HDMI Male adapter
- HDMI Male to HDMI Male mini 3m (for goggles)
- HDZERO RX and suitable antennas

Uses some 3D STL from standard Sentinel tracker 

Special note:
An improved pan servo may be needed for additional weight of HD units. In the options folder are STL and source for a variant that uses 2-6T sail winch servos which provides a very stable pan solution however requires a suitable sail winch servo. Kingmax SW22HV is recommend but untested.
If using the 2-gT sail servo, print the servo gear at finest detail resolution typically less than 0.1mm resolution. It will need some manipulation to fit he servo spline.
